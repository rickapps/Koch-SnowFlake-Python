# Koch-SnowFlake-Python
Draws each iteration of a Koch snowflake.  

I am learning Python using the two books Diving into Python3 and Python Playground.  Python Playground is an interesting book. The Koch snowflake is an exercise the book suggests. Look on Wikipedia to see an animation of the iterations of the snowflake. The animation inspired the output of this program.  Most of the math is from StackOverflow.
